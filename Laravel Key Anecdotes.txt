Laravel Key Anecdotes:
!* = not a factual anecdote yet
/* = good knowledge comment in the actual code
Middleware is all registered in Kernel.php
Middleware is separated in web/api and route middleware
Difference between Controllers and Middleware? 
-- Controllers are more tightly coupled to the framework. 
-- Controllers are specifically for request and return responses. 
    -- Middleware can wrap around this further to properly prepare the requests and responses for the middleware

Middleware is Regestered in Kernel.php, controllers and routes are registered in routes/api.phpORweb.php

URL's and associative arrays are cap sensitive remember (unless I function them to not be!)

!* I think the Closure $next thing is just so you can dynamically name which middleware function or whatever you want to call next (best guess in usage so far)

/*declaring routes is interchangeable in this file and in the
    usercontroller.php as long as you get the different syntaxes right in each location*/
